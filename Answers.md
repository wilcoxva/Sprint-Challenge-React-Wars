1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

    React JS is a JavaScript library used in web development to build interactive elements on websites. Before React JS, developers were stuck building UIs by hand with “vanilla JavaScript”  or with less UI-focused React predecessors like jQuery. That meant longer development times and plenty of opportunities for errors and bugs. So, in 2011, Facebook engineer Jordan Walke created React JS specifically to improve UI development.

1. What does it mean to think in react?

    Think about how you;re going to build components, ie start with a mock, break down the ui, build a static version, etc.

1. Describe state.

    State is an object that represents the parts of the app that can change.

1. Describe props.

    “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

    A side effect is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. We can sync effects by passing in a dependency array as the second argument to the effect hook.
